## backup_script

This script allows user to compare 2 folders - source folder and destination folder - in a specific way:
* files or folders in source that don't exist in destination will be copied over
* in a given folder of the source, if files were deleted, then deletion will also be carried out in the destination folder
* if a folder is deleted in the source, it won't be deleted in the destination
